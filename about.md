I'm a 19 year old studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in [Berkeley, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California). I'm originally from [Gurnee, IL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurnee,_Illinois).

I'm not much of a writer, but I'm trying to change that. On this blog I post my thoughts and musings, mostly for my own records. If you want to follow along, you're more than welcome.
