title: Winter Break and Data Visualization
---

**Since** last year's winter break, I've made it a goal of mine to learn something new over the course of each winter break. Last year I participated in [24 Pull Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/), and this break I've decided to learn [d3](http://d3js.org/).

d3 is a JavaScript library used to make data visualizations. I've always loved looking at cool maps or charts, but I never knew how to make them. d3 allows you to do this.

Before I get all technical, here's a picture from my vacation to Costa Rica to start my winter break. It was an amazing country, and if you haven't gotten the chance to visit I highly recommend it.

I got a bit of exposure to d3 this summer while working at [Lob](https://lob.com/), but I didn't have a firm understanding of it. My goal this break was to learn d3 well enough to be able to create data visualizations that are nice to look at, and convey relevant information. What is data visualization exactly? 

```It involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data, meaning "information that has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of information" - Wikipedia``` 

I started off by reading through [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html). The example code for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book). I think this is a great book to get started with d3, and there are many other d3 tutorials to be found all over the internet. I'm adding a d3 section to my website where I'll post links to my projects on d3 hosted with [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/) by Mike Bostock. For my first d3 project, I made two chloropleth maps of the United States. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher fast food consumption and industrial emissions in each state. I'll leave the conjecturing up to you!

Expenditures on fast food per state per capita (2012 - Data provided by the FDA)
</div>

<img src="/public/emissions-choro.png"/>
<div class="message">
Emissions per state (2013 - Data provided by the EPA)
</div> 


There's a lot more to d3 than what I've described here; I highly recommend taking a look at [Mike Bostock's d3 examples.](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery_) There are huge amounts of data just waiting to be explored. A great resource is [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/open-gov/). If working on projects with d3 is something you're interested in, [drop me a line](mailto:a.ayalur@gmail.com), and let's chat!

This post's featured song is *The Knocks - Classic (Powers' Sunset Remix)*. Recently I've been listening to a lot of electronic music, and I think this track embodies my electronic music taste fairly well. Smooth vocals, pulsing beats, and soft synths interplay throughout the song, and it's a great listen for anyone interested in "chill" music. Enjoy!
