**Right now**, I'm currently 34,000 feet in the air on a flight home from Berkeley. Final exams ended just yesterday, and this winter break is exactly the respite I need after a seemingly interminable semester.

It's pretty crazy to think that I'm halfway done with my sophomore year of college. It feels like freshman year was just last week! In my time so far at school, I've met a lot of incredible people (*if you're reading this you're probably one of them*), and I've had some unforgettable experiences.

Some of the most awesome people I know.

I've realized that I've grown a lot as a person since starting college a year ago, but sometimes it's hard to quantify or qualify that growth. The best way to observe growth is on the basis of reflection -- and that's why I'm starting this blog. I want to start writing to create another outlet for my thoughts and ramblings, and these posts are mostly for myself and for self-reflection. By sharing my posts with you I hope to get your feedback on anything at all: my writing style, my opinions, or even my music taste (*I really like music*). If you want to send me feedback, you can always tweet at me [@amritayalur](https://www.twitter.com/aayalur), drop me an [email](mailto:a.ayalur@gmail.com), or just find me in person!

Although these posts are considered my "ramblings", I want each blog post to have a theme. This post's theme is **Resolutions**. 2015 is just around the corner, and it's always a tradition to make a resolution for the New Year.

My resolution this year is to **record everything**. Write blog posts, take pictures, record videos, and save memories.

I've always been the type of person to live in the moment, but I'm realizing now that some moments are hard to recall purely from memories. I've never been a fan of being in pictures or videos, but the more experiences I have, the more I realize that these are moments I want to save forever. 20 years from now, I want to be able to look back and read what my 19 year old mind was thinking about. You could say that this blog is my personal time capsule.

My goal is to make one blog post every 2 weeks, and I'll try my best to meet that timeline. If I can't post that frequently, I will take this blog down and revert my personal website to the portfolio site it was before. Keeping an inactive blog just seems to defeat the entire purpose of having a blog.

Lastly, I'm a huge fan of music. At the bottom of each post I'll write a quick snippet about a notable track I've been listening to recently.

This track comes off *Under Pressure*, Logic's first album. I've listened to Logic's music before, but this song is easily my favorite of his. Logic excellently manipulates rhythm in *Gang Related*, and his wordplay is impressive. An analysis of the lyrics is on [Genius](http://genius.com/Logic-gang-related-lyrics). If you want to follow along with more of the music I've been listening to recently, check out my [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/amritayalur). I'd love to hear what you're listening to!

Thanks for reading.
